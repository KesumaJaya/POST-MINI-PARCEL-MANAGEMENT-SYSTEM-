<h1>POST-MINI PARCEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>	

<strong>ICT200 â€“ INTRODUCTION TO DATABASE</strong>

The Post-Mini Parcel Management System is a tool used to manage every parcel that arrives at Post Mini. Its purpose is to facilitate the work of the staff in organizing the parcels and processing payments when students come to pick up their items. The staff only needs to scan the parcel, and the details will automatically be inserted into the database. The next step is to assign a code specifying where the item is stored. This system helps streamline the parcel management process and ensures that everything is organized efficiently. (develop using MySQL)
